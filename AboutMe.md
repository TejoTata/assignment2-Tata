# Tejo Lakshmi Tata
I'm Tejo Lakshmi Tata, and I was born and raised in Bapatla, which is well-known for having Suryalanka Beach. I attended Gems High School and Graduated in 2021 from Vignan's Foundation for Science, Technology, and Research. I enjoy playing video games and am really interested in yoga when I have free time.
